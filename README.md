# Unit Converter Project 🌡️📏

This is a simple Python application developed as part of my Computer Science studies to practice fundamental programming concepts.

## 🚀 Purpose
The goal of this project was to apply basic logic to solve real-world unit conversion problems, focusing on:
- User input handling.
- Data type manipulation (converting strings to floats).
- Mathematical operations in Python.
- String formatting (f-strings).

## 🛠️ Features
- **Temperature Conversion:** Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **Distance Conversion:** Converts Kilometers to Miles.
- **Formatted Output:** Results are rounded to two decimal places for better readability.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Tools:** GitHub for version control.

## 📖 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the `converter.py` file.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 converter.py
